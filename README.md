**Cerebro** is an ExpressJS server, running on Apollo Server, that provides access to information about Marvel comics, characters and more.

## How to install

To install required dependencies, run

```
npm install
```

> Developed with Node v14.15.4

## How to run in local environment

First, create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`) and paste your public and private key to access Marvel Developer APIs.
Then, in the root folder, run

```
npm run dev
```

You will see something like this in the terminal

```
ðŸš€ Server is ready at http://localhost:4001/graphql
```

Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:4001/graphql.

## Apollo Studio

Every time I start the server, the schema is automatically registered on [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/cerebro). Publishing the schema unlocks useful festures such as **usage statistics** and the **schema changelog**.
